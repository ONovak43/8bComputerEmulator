# 8bComputerEmulator
The goal of the project is to create an emulator for an *8-bit computer* using C++ based on the repository https://github.com/ONovak43/8bitComputer.

For the time being, instructions are entered into the computer directly in the project code (the image variable in the main.cpp file is the instruction that the computer executes).
